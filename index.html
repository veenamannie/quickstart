   <h2> Install ownCloud Server </h2>
This section walks you through installing ownCloud using a tar file or a zip file.
<blockquote> 
   **Note:** The installation using the ownCloud tarball is best suited for production environments and is also the common installation option. The installation procedure is for experienced administrators and it offers a customizable installation method.

To install ownCloud server, follow these steps:
1. Go to the [ownCloud download page](https://owncloud.org/download/).

2. From the **Resources** section, download either the **Tar file** or **Zip file**. Based on your preference, a file downloads with the name `owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2` (tar installation) or `owncloud-x.y.z.zip` (zip installation), where *x.y.z* is the version number.

3. Download the corresponding checksum file. The supported options are md5 and sha256.

4. Verify the MD5 or SHA256 sum.

    **Tar:**
     <code>
      md5sum -c owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.md5 < owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2<br>
      sha256sum -c owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.sha256 < owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2
     </code>

    **Zip:**
     <code>
      md5sum  -c owncloud-x.y.z.zip.md5 < owncloud-x.y.z.zip<br>
      sha256sum  -c owncloud-x.y.z.zip.sha256 < owncloud-x.y.z.zip
     </code>

5. Download the PGP signature file. The supported format is asc.

6.	Verify the PGP signature.

      <code>
       wget https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.asc <br>
       wget https://owncloud.org/owncloud.asc <br>
       gpg --import owncloud.asc <br>
       gpg --verify owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.asc owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2 <br>
      </code>

7. Extract the archived contents.

    **Tar:**
    <code>
    tar -xjf owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2 <br>
    </code>
    
    **Zip:**
    <code>
    unzip owncloud-x.y.z.zip <br>
    </code>

The content is unpacked to an `owncloud` directory. Copy this directory to a destination of your preference. 

8. Run the Apache HTTP server to install ownCloud in your Apache document root.

> **Note:** On HTTP servers, it is recommended to install ownCloud outside of the document root.

   <code>
    cp -r owncloud /path/to/webserver/document-root
   </code>

The path is replaced by the document root of your web server:

   <code>
    cp -r owncloud /var/www
   </code>
